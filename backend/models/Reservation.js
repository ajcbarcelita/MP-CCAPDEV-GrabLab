/**
 * Reservation Model
 * Represents a reservation for a lab seat and time slot.
 * Each reservation is linked to a user, a lab, a date, and one or more slots (seat + time).
 * - user_id: The user who made the reservation
 * - lab_id: The lab being reserved
 * - reservation_date: The date of the reservation
 * - slots: Array of seat/time slot objects
 * - anonymous: If true, user info is hidden
 * - status: Reservation status (Active, Cancelled, Completed)
 *
 * See backend/controllers/reservationController.js for how reservations are created and validated.
